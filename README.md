# UE4Multiplayer

This is a Unreal Engine 4 based multiplayer game that can be played over both LAN and Internet, it makes use of steam servers to host/serve the games.

The following two plugins have been used in this project :
  1. Advanced Sessions v4.26
  2. Steam Multiplayer v4.26

Which can be added to the projects trough the plugins tab under Edit
The game is still in its early phase where I was exploring the concept of online multiplayer games, I will be working on this project as soon as I have time to spare
